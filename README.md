# Numerical-schemes-for-discontinuities
Numerical CFD schemes dealing with discontinuities.

This is a collection of scripts used for my blog to generate figures. see
https://daydreamatnight.github.io/2022/06/18/FVM-schemes-fundamentals/

fortran and gnuplot is required to run the script.

```shell
gfortran codename.f90
./a.out

```
